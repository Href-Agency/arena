# Href Tailwind Starter Theme Roadmap

## Requirements
This is the roadmap for the Href starter kit to list beneficial features for internal software to improve productivity and quality of life for developers.

## Boilerplate Features
1. Automatic staging setup via terminal. LCN/Plesk connection maybe over a Headless browser to setup Staging site, and link repository via SSH keys.
2. Internally hosted block library to import white-labelled components into your project.
3. Switch hosting environment for everybody over to Docker Dev - Helps with cross-platform integration and easier local setups.
